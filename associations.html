<h1>Leadership Roles in Associations<h1></h1>
<p>
I have been involved in professional associations at both the regional and national level, giving me the honor and opportunity to help inform my field. 
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ahead.org">AHEAD</a> is the National Association on Higher Education and Disability. I have been a member since 2002 and have presented at conferences and in pre-conference sessions, bringing the Disability History Exhibit to the national conferences twice.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ahead.org/learn/virtual-learning/at_webinars_14_15">AHEAD Access to Technology Series</a> is a series of professional development opportunities offered online through the Association on Higher Education and Disability. As co-chair of the Standing Committee on Technology (2013-2015) I worked collaboratively to facilitate the cultivation and deployment of a webinar series as well as a double conference strand. In addition, while in position I was able to make recommendations for creation of a shared respository that would allow standing committee leaders to upload meeting notes, something that eases the transition and facilitates onboarding of new leaders.</li> 
<li><a href="http://www.naspa.org">NASPA Disability Knowledge Community</a> is a knoweldge communitity within a very large professional association of student affairs professionals. I served as the NASPA Disability KC Regional Representative and was then elected into the national chair position where I worked with our leadership team and members to raise concerns about conference accessibility. We were successful in securing specific changes and increased our membership numbers considerably during the two terms I served. Our leadership team held regular conference calls and issued a quarterly newsletter for our members. I served as a liaison between the Disability and Technology Knowledge Communities and advocated for the development of a web accessibility statement and related guidance for volunteers who populate the webspace.</li>
<li>Board of Directors for the Alaksa Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired</li>
<li><a href="http://orahead.org">ORAHEAD</a> is the Association on Higher Education and Disability. I have been proud to serve on the Board of Directors. In my tenure I have introudced pre-conference sessions and drafted and passed revisions to the by-laws, invigorated the Collaboration of Rehabilitation and Education (CORE) and energized an awareness of the potential for Open Educational Resources to improve accessibility.</li>
