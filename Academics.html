I love taking what I have learned in the classroom and applying it to the real world, and simultaneously, taking what I have found in practice, and infusing it within my studies.

I have a portfolio that was created while completing my Master's Degree which contains samples going all the way back to some of my very first college courses as a seventeen year old. Please see this Prior academic work as context for my journey as a learner.
