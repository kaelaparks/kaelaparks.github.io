<p>
We live in an information age. Access to information is a basic civil right. Yet, for many individuals, access to online information and services are denied, or impeded, because the design does not afford flexibility or align with standards.  As a practitioner who works in higher education with students who are at risk of encountering barriers on the basis of disabilty, I feel an ethical responsibility to promote policy and practice that opens up engagement points in ways that are equitable. 
<h2>Please consider the following belief statements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I believe that we have an ethical responsibility to design learning opportunities that can be leveraged by a naturally diverse population in ways that are equitable. My commitment to Diversity & Inclusiveness can be seen in the work I have done to promote Universal Design.</li>
<li>I believe that technology coupled with human support can have an enormous impact on learning and development.</li> 
<li>I believe we have an ethical responsibility as educators to create navigable pathways that allow students to get in and out and along their way.</li> 
<li>I believe we have a responsibility to ensure our students are provided with more than just content knowledge, and that we should help to facilitate development by building resilience, adaptability, critical problem solving, and communication skills along the way.</li>
<li>I believe that educational leaders have a responsibility to use evidence-informed decision making when crafting policy, defining standard practice, and resolving concerns.</li>
</ul>
The notion that we can look beyond the boundaries of our institutional walls to forge mutually beneficial relationships with community partners is key to my professional approach.
