<h1>Philosophy Statement<h1></h1>

<p>
We live in an information age. Access to information is a basic civil right. Yet, for many individuals, access to online information and services are denied, or impeded, because the design does not afford flexibility or align with standards.  As a practitioner who works in higher education with students who are at risk of encountering barriers, I feel an ethical responsibility to promote policy and practice that opens up engagement points in ways that are equitable. Please consider the following belief statements.
•	I believe that we have an ethical responsibility to design learning opportunities that can be leveraged by a naturally diverse population in ways that are equitable. My commitment to Diversity & Inclusiveness can be seen in the work I have done to promote Universal Design. I helped to write, and served in a critical role within, the federal grant that the University of Alaska Anchorage was awarded to improve educational outcomes for students who experience disability. The grant funded effort was called CAPRA, the College Access Project for Rural Alaska, and it presented an opportunity to work closely with part-time faculty to introduce greater flexibility within course design on small rural campuses.
•	I believe that integrating Research-Based Practices & Professional Standards is not only important, but vital. As I have transitioned into more administrative roles I have worked hard to ensure I also remain firmly enmeshed as a practitioner, staying tuned in to the work of colleagues and looking to professional associations for updates and guidance. I have engaged in program review using a variety of approaches and was deeply honored to be asked to serve as an expert reviewer for the Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education (CAS) on the Disability Services and Resources chapter.
•	I believe that technology coupled with human support can have an enormous Impact on Learning and Development. I believe in working smarter and harder – I believe in silver buckshot more than silver bullets and I am committed to ensuring each individual is afforded the opportunity to make informed choices. I believe we have an ethical responsibility as educators to create navigable pathways that allow students to get in and out and along their way. I believe we have a responsibility to ensure our students are provided with more than just content knowledge. I believe that we should help to facilitate development by building resilience, adaptability, critical problem solving, and communication skills along the way. I believe in a sense of shared responsibility.
•	I believe that educational leaders have a responsibility to use Evidence-Informed Decision Making when crafting policy, defining standard practice, and resolving concerns. We must be more than implementers. We must question what we are doing and seek out the feedback and ideas that can help us improve effectiveness and efficiency while moving toward greater social justice and equity. 
The notion that we can look beyond the boundaries of our institutional walls to forge mutually beneficial relationships with community partners is key to my professional approach. So too is the notion that our curriculum should help our students and graduates understand the real world challenges as well as the opportunities to address them proactively.
