<h1>Professional Work<h1></h1>
<p>
I am a Disability Services professional who has been actively engaged at the institutional, regional, and national levels. I serve in leadership positions within professional associations and have been fortunate to have experience working on both grant funded universal design projects and collaborative awareness building efforts. The annotated links below hilight some of the projects and initiatives I have worked on.
<p> 
<h2>Collaborations</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.disrepresentation.com">Dis/Representation</a> is a  disability studies community event offered collaboratively through Portland Community College, Portland State University, and the Disability Arts and Culture Project.
<li><img src="https://www.ahead.org/events/AT_webinar_2014/TechAccessLogo.jpg" alt="AHEAD Access to Technology with image of gears turning"><a href="https://www.ahead.org/learn/virtual-learning/at_webinars_14_15">AHEAD Access to Technology Series</a> As co-chair of the Standing Committee on Technology I have been responsible for facilitating the cultivation and deployment of a webinar series as well as a conference strand. 
<li><a href="http://www.uaa.alaska.edu/dss/information/reeleyes/index.cfm">Reel Eyes Showcasae of Films By and About People with Disabilites</a> is an event that I facilitated for several years. Films were shown at multiple locations across the state of Alaska. It was a wonderful experience and I was able to design and deliver courses that ran alongside the series. Different years the course was offered through different colleges, so there were a variety of disciplines participating. Courses were offered in  Psychology, Education, Social Work, and Guidance cross-listed across levels.
<li><a href="https://edit.uaa.alaska.edu/accessibility/training/web/stateofalaska.cfm">State of Alaska Web Accessibility Initiative</a> was a partnership betweeen the University of Alaska and the State of Alaska. I worked closely with the State ADA Coordinator to plan and deliver two day trainings twice per year. We brought web developers and content authors from the state and from the university and held joint trainings that were capped at 30. We had full crowds each time we offered it, with some repeat customers. The trainings were offered from 2008 to 2012 with a final session  offered jointly with Portland Community College in 2013.
<li><a href="http://www.uaa.alaska.edu/dss/information/adacelebration.cfm">ADA Celebrations</a> in Alaska were a very collaborative undertaking with both financial contributions on the part of the University, which took advocacy to secure, and  investments of time and energy.</li>
<li><a href="http://dhss.alaska.gov/gcdse/Pages/history/index.aspx">Disability History Exhibit</a> chronicles the treatment of people with disabilities over time, from multiple angles including a moral, medical, and social perspective. I reached out to the group who had created it and brokered a deal. I offered to create an accessible electronic version in exchange for half off the cost of the display. The display typically cost $6,000 but with my labor along with contributions from the State of Alaska ADA Coordinatorâ€™s office and the State Independent Living Center it only cost my institution $1,000.</li>
</ul>
The notion that we can look beyond the boundaries of our institutional walls to forge mutually beneficial relationships with community partners is key to my professional approach.
